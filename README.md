# Fast-Food-Ordering-App

This is a fast food ordering application developed by my group for SWE 3313 Introduction to Software Engineering (KSU). It was developed in Java/ JavaFX and uses a text file system to store the orders of customers. Each student was responsible for writting implementation code and collaborate on documentation.

The code folder contains the jar file for the application in addition to all the code and assets required for the application. The document folder contains a master development document containing the project plan, requirements document, system design document, and UI design sections. The project plan defines the issue, goes over hardware/ software requirements, goes over the decision on what coding format the group will use, and develops a plan for the product's completion. The requirements document defines functional/ non-functional/ system requiirements and includeds use case diagrams, class diagrams/ documentation, ER diagrams, and state transition diagrams. The system design document contains conceptual design documents (such as receipt and order formats), class and table diagrams, and technical support specification. Finally, The UI design sections are divided into two sections (prototype 1 and 2) which show the progression of changes in UI between the middle and end of the semester.
